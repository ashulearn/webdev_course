Node.js is an interpretor for java script which enables us to run the java script code
in our computer. Back in 1995 the java script language was created just to make 
the websites responsive and it was not used in backend coding because it was slow as compared to C++
and JAVA . but in 2005 the google tried to improve it's java script engine in it's browser
which made the engine so fast that it could run java script at a speed compairable to C++ 
so people started using java script as a backend language also. In 2010 a student in 
college took the v8 javascript engine from goole's browser and tried to run it on 
terminal this is what we call now a days node.js

Any browser has two engines
1. Layout Engine (renders html css)
2. java script Engine (renders java script)
