The steps we folled to make this are
1. first we have done npm init and npm install express
2. then we requied the expres in the servers.js file and made the handler for the '/' and started the server by using app.listen
3. then we have made the public folder 
    public folder is a folder where we place a static part of the website which doesn't change using 
    app.use('/public',express.static(folder path))

4. then we made index.html ,todolist.html,todolist.js and downloaded the jquery
5. now we made the routes folder which will handle routes from todolist.html
6. In the routes folder we have made the todos.js which requires the express router
and used it to handle get and post requests we have an array of objects named todos 
when there is a get request it just sends the array and when there is a post request
it pushes the req.body.task in the todos array
