Handlebars is a templating language. When we created todo-list we inserted many variables in the html using backticks(``) 
and dollar symbol but it gets ugly with time so we use handle bars to write it easily
there are many other teplating languages also but we will use handle bars

for using hbs(handlebars) first do npm install hbs
then we will create a folder named views and keep all the hbs files there
now we will set app.set('view engine' ,'hbs') which sets the view engine
if we would use jade or any other view engine we will set it to that
now in the response do res.render(hbs file name)
