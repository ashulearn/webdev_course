Strongly typed means, a will not be automatically converted from one type to another.
 Weakly typed is the opposite: Perl can use a string like "123" in a numeric context,
  by automatically converting it into the int 123. A strongly typed language like python will not do this.

Statically typed means, the compiler figures out the type of each variable at compile time.
 Dynamically typed languages only figure out the types of variables at runtime
