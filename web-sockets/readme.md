# web sockets

```
web sockets is protocol build on the http protocol. When we communicate through http protocol 
onl the client can send req to the server , there is no way the server can send any info. to the 
client. So web sockets were introduced .
```
# architecture

```
In web sockets a pipeline connection is made between the server and the client .So let us consider 
John and Jina are talking to each other on chat.com John is on Chrome browser and Jina is on firefox
When John send a message in form of request to server to send to Jina a pipeline connection is made 
between John and server and Jina and server now all the req and res will go through this path only.  
```
